# Where did the PyWorker code go?
We have moved the PyWorker source code into the `vastai-sdk` Python SDK.
You can install it with
```
pip install vastai-sdk
```

All of the source code can be found here:
https://github.com/vast-ai/vast-sdk

And can be imported from vastai.serverless.server.lib

Serverless instances automatically run the start_server.sh script, which installs the vastai-sdk.
This is how the PyWorker source code makes it onto your serverless instances.
You provide a worker.py file in your PYWORKER_REPO, and the start_server.sh will 
create and run a PyWorker according to your configuration defined in the file.

While you can still create and run PyWorkers for serverless using your old PyWorker code,
we **strongly** encourage you to use the new worker.py configuration method, since
we can guarantee backwards compatibility for all your worker definitions. No more forking pyworker :)

If you encounter and issues with using PyWorker, please create a GitHub issue and we will be happy to assist.
